## üìä Data Source & Structure

The dashboard connects to a database with the following core tables:

*   **`sales`**: Contains individual transaction records (sale_id, date, product_id, sales_rep_id, quantity, sale_amount, cost).
*   **`products`**: Product master data (product_id, product_name, category, price).
*   **`sales_team`**: Information about sales representatives (sales_rep_id, name, region).
*   **`regions`**: Lookup table for regions (region_id, region_name).

A detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) can be found in the `docs/` folder.

## üß© Usage Guide

1.  **View the Overview:** Upon loading, the dashboard displays a summary of key metrics for the default date range (e.g., Last Quarter).
2.  **Filter Data:** Use the filter controls at the top of the page to select a specific:
    *   Date Range (e.g., Last Month, Q1, Custom Range)
    *   Region (e.g., North America, Europe)
    *   Product Category (e.g., Electronics, Apparel)
3.  **Interact with Charts:** Hover over chart elements to see detailed figures. Click on legend items to show/hide specific data series (e.g., toggle between regions on a trend line).
4.  **Export Data:** Click the download icon (`‚¨áÔ∏è`) on any chart to save it as an image, or use the "Export Data" button to get a CSV of the currently filtered dataset.

## üîß API Endpoints
